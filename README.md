# Find-dialogbox
A find dialog box just like you find in any text or source editor. Written in Qt 4 It even has the outgoing signals to be connected with a larger application

It has accelerator keys (use ALT + underlined letter to select the respective widgets)

Was initially written in Qt 3 from a book program, modified to work under Qt 4.8.6 and added a few more things

Has it's own cool program icon :)
